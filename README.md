# Fog Off

**Exploration should be earned.**

Fog Off is an open-source application that transforms physical movement into visible territory.
The world does not start revealed. It becomes visible as you move through it.
Every step contributes to a map shaped by lived experience.

## Principle

The map becomes a record of presence.
A visual representation of exploration.
A footprint of real movement.

- Encouraging intentional exploration  
- Making movement visible  
- Turning geography into progress  
- Building a shared map defined by real human activity

## Open by Design

Fog Off is open source. The system should be inspectable and community-driven.
Anyone can contribute.

---

## Status

Early-stage project.
Actively evolving.

The map is still mostly fog.
