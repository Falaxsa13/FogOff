# Fog Off

**Exploration should be earned.**

Fog Off is an open-source application that transforms physical movement into visible territory.

The world does not start revealed.
It becomes visible as you move through it.

Every step contributes to a map shaped by lived experience — not preloaded data.

## The Principle

Most digital maps are static. They show everything at once.

Fog Off reverses that model.

You only see where you have been.

The map becomes a record of presence.
A visual representation of exploration.
A footprint of real movement.

---

## The Direction

Fog Off is not about navigation.

It is about:

- Encouraging intentional exploration  
- Making movement visible  
- Turning geography into progress  
- Building a shared map defined by real human activity  

Over time, the revealed world reflects collective presence — not corporate abstraction.

---

## Open by Design

Fog Off is open source.

Exploration should not be proprietary.
Movement data should not be opaque.
The system should be inspectable and community-driven.

Anyone can contribute.
Anyone can fork.
No single entity owns the idea of revealing the world.

---

## Status

Early-stage project.
Actively evolving.

The map is still mostly fog.
